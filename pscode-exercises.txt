// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

num = 6
if num % 2 == 0
print ("even number")
else
print ("odd number")


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

Declare integers variables n1, n2, n3, n4, n5

Declare variables avg, large, small

input n1

input n2

input n3

input n4

input n5

calculate and assign avg = n1 PL n2 PL n3 PL n4 PL n5 DIVIDE 5

if n1 greater than n2, n3, n4, n5 Then

large = n1

else if n2 greater than n1, n3, n4, n5 Then

large = n2

else if n3 greater than n1, n2, n4, n5 Then

large = n3

else if n4 greater than n1, n2, n4, n5 Then

large = n4

else

large = n5

if n1 less than n2, n3, n4, n5 Then

small = n1

else if n2 less than n1, n3, n4, n5 Then

small = n2

else if n3 less than n1, n2, n4, n5 Then

small = n3

else if n4 less than n1, n2, n4, n5 Then

small = n4

else

small = n5

Print "The average of five numbers is : avg"

Print "The smallest number among five numbers is : small"

Print "The largest number among five numbers is : large"
